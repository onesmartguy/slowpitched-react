---

## Option 1: Test Mobile App Only (Quickest)

**Timeline**: 15-20 minutes

### Steps:

1. **Start the EAS Build**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/eddie.flores/source/slowpitched-react
   npx eas build --profile preview --platform ios
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter your Apple ID credentials
   - Allow EAS to create certificates
   - Wait for build to complete

3. **Install on iPhone**:
   - Open the build URL on your iPhone
   - Tap "Install"
   - Trust the certificate in Settings

4. **Test the App**:
   - All core features will work
   - Local database on device
   - No server connection needed for basic functionality

**What Works**:
- ✅ Camera tracking
- ✅ Pitch logging
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Statistics
- ✅ CSV export
- ❌ WebSocket real-time updates (requires server)
- ❌ ML analytics API (requires server)

## Option 2: Test Complete System with MCP Server

**Timeline**: 30-40 minutes

### Part A: Deploy MCP Server

**Option A1: Local Server (Same WiFi)**

1. **Find Your Mac's IP**:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   # Note the IP like: 192.168.1.123
   ```

2. **Start MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/eddie.flores/source/slowpitched-react/mcp-server

   # First time setup
   cp .env.example .env
   pnpm install

   # Start server
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. **Server runs at**:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (on Mac)
   - `http://192.168.1.123:3000` (from iPhone on same WiFi)

**Option A2: Cloud Server (Accessible Anywhere)**

1. **Deploy to Railway** (free tier):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   cd mcp-server
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

   Get your URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Part B: Configure Mobile App

Before building, update the API configuration:

```typescript
// apps/mobile/src/config/api.ts (create this file)
export const API_CONFIG = {
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.1.123:3000',  // Your Mac's IP or Railway URL
  wsURL: 'ws://192.168.1.123:3000',      // Or wss://your-app.railway.app
};
```

### Part C: Build and Install Mobile App

Same as Option 1 - run EAS build:

```bash
npx eas build --profile preview --platform ios
```

**What Works**:
- ✅ Everything from Option 1
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates
- ✅ ML analytics (predictions, anomalies, trends)
- ✅ Server-side data sync
- ✅ Multi-user features

---

## Recommended Approach

### For Your First Test:

**Start with Option 1** (Mobile App Only):
1. This gets the app on your phone fastest
2. Tests all core tracking features
3. Validates camera, calibration, and pitch logging
4. No server setup needed

### Then Add Option 2:

Once the mobile app works:
1. Start local MCP server on your Mac
2. Rebuild mobile app with server config
3. Test real-time features and ML analytics

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: MCP Server TypeScript Build Error

**Status**: The MCP server code is complete but has import path issues

**Impact**: Server can't build with `pnpm run build`

**Workaround Options**:

1. **Use development mode** (works immediately):
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   pnpm run dev  # Uses ts-node, no build needed
   ```

2. **Fix for production** (requires code changes):
   - Option A: Create standalone mock database
   - Option B: Configure TypeScript paths properly
   - Option C: Convert to microservices architecture

**For Testing**: Option 1 (dev mode) works perfectly and is recommended

### Issue 2: Apple Developer Certificate

**Status**: EAS build will prompt for Apple credentials

**Solution**: Have your Apple ID ready when running build command

**Alternative**: Use TestFlight (requires paid Apple Developer account $99/year)

---
