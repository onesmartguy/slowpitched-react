## 🚧 Known Issues & Blockers

### Issue #1: React Hooks Testing Compatibility

**Problem**: React 19 / React Native Testing Library compatibility

**Symptoms**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentOwner')
```

**Root Cause**:
- Project uses React 19.0.0
- React Native Testing Library expects React 18
- react-test-renderer has version conflicts
- @testing-library/react-hooks incompatible with React 19

**Impact**:
- Cannot test React hooks directly (useCalibration, useFrameProcessing, etc.)
- Cannot test React components with Testing Library
- 318 lines of hook code untestable
- 331 lines of component code untestable

**Workarounds**:
1. **Focus on Service/Utility Testing** ✅
   - Test pure JavaScript/TypeScript code
   - Database services, utilities, calculations
   - Achievable coverage: 50-60%

2. **Integration/E2E Testing** ⏳
   - Use Detox for E2E tests
   - Test hooks/components in actual workflows
   - Validates behavior without unit tests

3. **Manual Testing** ⏳
   - Test React components manually during development
   - Document test scenarios

**Resolution Options** (Future):
- Downgrade React to 18.x (breaking change)
- Wait for React Native Testing Library React 19 support
- Use alternative testing approach (Enzyme, manual)
- Accept lower coverage for React code

**Current Decision**: Focus Phase 7.1 on testable code (services, utilities), defer React testing

## 💬 Notes & Observations

### Testing Philosophy
- **Pragmatic over Perfect**: Focus on achievable, high-impact testing
- **Testable First**: Prioritize code that can be tested with current infrastructure
- **Coverage is a Metric, Not a Goal**: Quality tests matter more than coverage percentages
- **E2E Validates Behavior**: Use E2E tests to cover what unit tests cannot

### Technical Debt
- React testing infrastructure needs resolution (technical debt logged)
- Some modules (hooks, components) may have lower coverage initially
- E2E tests will provide confidence for untested React code

### Team Readiness
- All planning documentation complete
- Clear tasks for next 3 days
- Success criteria defined
- Tools and dependencies ready
