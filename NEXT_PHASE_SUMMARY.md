   - Identify any questions or concerns
   - Prioritize tasks based on criticality

2. **Set Up Testing Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Install testing dependencies
   cd apps/mobile
   pnpm add -D @testing-library/react-native detox

   # Install load testing tools
   cd ../../mcp-server
   pnpm add -D artillery supertest
   ```

3. **Begin Test Coverage Enhancement**
   - Start with critical services (database, tracking)
   - Add tests for React hooks
   - Set up E2E test framework

4. **Configure Monitoring (Early Setup)**
   - Create Sentry account
   - Set up error tracking
   - Configure basic logging

5. **Security Baseline**
   - Run initial security scan (Snyk)
   - Document current vulnerabilities
   - Plan remediation

---

## 💡 Key Considerations

### Testing Strategy
- **Prioritize critical paths first** (calibration, tracking, data export)
- **Automate everything** to enable continuous testing
- **Test on real devices** for camera and performance validation

### Performance
- **Profile before optimizing** to find real bottlenecks
- **Measure everything** with proper benchmarks
- **Test on low-end devices** to ensure broad compatibility

### Security
- **Security is not optional** - address all findings
- **Use established libraries** for auth and crypto
- **Regular updates** for dependencies

### Deployment
- **Staging must match production** exactly
- **Test rollbacks** before production deployment
- **Gradual rollout** to minimize risk
