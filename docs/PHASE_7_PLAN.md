## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Prioritize critical paths first, aim for breadth before depth
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Profile early, optimize hot paths, use proper indexing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Run automated scanners, conduct manual review, penetration testing
- **Deployment Issues**: Test in staging first, implement gradual rollout, maintain rollback plan

### Operational Risks

- **Timeline Overrun**: Prioritize must-have vs nice-to-have, adjust scope if needed
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Write docs as you go, not at the end
- **Insufficient Testing**: Automate wherever possible, continuous testing in CI/CD
- **Production Incidents**: Prepare runbooks, establish on-call rotation, practice incident response
