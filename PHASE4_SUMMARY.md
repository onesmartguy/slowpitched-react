- Date range selector
- Multiple session comparison
- PDF export (in addition to CSV)
- Chart visualizations (line graphs, histograms)
- Session tagging/categories
- Bulk operations (delete multiple)
- Session archiving
- Data backup/restore
- Export format options (JSON, Excel)

---

## Integration with Previous Phases

### Phase 2 Integration
- Uses tracking pipeline for pitch detection
- Relies on calibration system
- Integrates with camera tracking

### Phase 3 Integration
- Uses all database services:
  - sessionService (get, delete)
  - pitchService (get pitches by session)
  - statisticsService (calculate summary)
- Leverages uncertainty calculations
- Uses session and pitch types
